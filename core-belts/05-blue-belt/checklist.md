## 🥋 Promotion Requirements - Blue Belt 💙

### Knowledge
- [ ] Can you explain the trade-offs between scalability, availability, and consistency?
- [ ] Can you explain different caching strategies and when to use them?
- [ ] Can you explain the basics of web security, including CORS and SQL injection?
- [ ] Can you explain what an SLO is and how it's used?
- [ ] Can you explain what Infrastructure as Code is?

### Project
- [ ] Capstone project is complete.
- [ ] Designed for scale: explain how it handles 10x traffic.
- [ ] Implements caching (Redis or similar) with a clear strategy.
- [ ] Security: secrets not in code, auth working, basic CORS.
- [ ] Monitoring: meaningful alerts, SLO defined, dashboards.
- [ ] IaC: infrastructure defined in code (can deploy from scratch).
- [ ] README with trade-offs: why this approach over others.

### Review
- [ ] System design interview: pass mock with peer/senior.
- [ ] Load tested at intended scale (explain results).
- [ ] Can explain every design decision (why Redis not Memcached?).
- [ ] Infrastructure reproducible: 1 command deploys everything.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] System design interview: pass mock with peer/senior.
- [ ] Load tested at intended scale (explain results).
- [ ] Can explain every design decision (why Redis not Memcached?).
- [ ] Infrastructure reproducible: 1 command deploys everything.
- [ ] 1 SLO defined + monitored (e.g., 99.9% availability).
