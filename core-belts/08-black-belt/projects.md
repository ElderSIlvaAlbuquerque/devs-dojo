# ⚫ Black Belt - Capstone Projects

Pick ONE project to graduate to the next belt.

## Project 1: Distributed ledger system
**Time**: 8-12 weeks
**Tech Stack**: A programming language of your choice
**Concepts**: This project is a deep dive into distributed consensus, fault tolerance, and building a system that is highly available and secure.
**Requirements**:
- Implement a simplified version of a distributed ledger system like a blockchain.
- The system should be able to tolerate Byzantine faults (malicious or broken nodes).
- The system should be able to come to a consensus on the order of transactions.
- The system should be able to handle a high volume of transactions.

## Project 2: Real-time platform
**Time**: 8-12 weeks
**Tech Stack**: A programming language of your choice, a real-time messaging system (e.g., WebSockets, gRPC), a database
**Concepts**: This project is about building a system that can handle a massive number of concurrent users and real-time updates.
**Requirements**:
- Build a real-time platform like a chat system, a notification system, or a social media feed.
- The system should be able to handle millions of concurrent users.
- The system should be able to deliver updates to users in real-time.
- The system should be highly available and resilient to failures.

## Project 3: Highly available system
**Time**: 8-12 weeks
**Tech Stack**: A cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP), a database that supports multi-region replication (e.g., CockroachDB, Spanner)
**Concepts**: This project is about building a system that has 99.99%+ uptime and is resilient to regional outages.
**Requirements**:
- Deploy a service to multiple regions.
- Use a database that supports multi-region replication.
- Implement a system for failing over to another region in the event of a regional outage.
- Implement a system for routing traffic to the closest region.
- The system should have 99.99%+ uptime.

## Project 4: Complex data processing system
**Time**: 8-12 weeks
**Tech Stack**: A programming language of your choice, a stream processing system (e.g., Flink, Spark Streaming), a batch processing system (e.g., Spark, Hadoop)
**Concepts**: This project is about building a system that can process a large volume of data, both in real-time and in batches.
**Requirements**:
- Build a data processing system that combines stream processing and batch processing.
- The system should be able to process a large volume of data from multiple sources.
- The system should be able to generate reports and analytics from the data.
- The system should be highly scalable and resilient to failures.
