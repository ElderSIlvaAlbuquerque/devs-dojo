## 🥋 Promotion Requirements - Brown Belt 🤎

### Knowledge
- [ ] Can you explain the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed systems?
- [ ] Can you explain different database replication strategies?
- [ ] Can you explain the concept of eventual consistency?
- [ ] Can you explain different API versioning strategies?
- [ ] Can you explain the circuit breaker pattern?

### Project
- [ ] Capstone project is complete.
- [ ] Handles sharding transparently (shard routing works).
- [ ] Replication + failover: 1 node down doesn't break the system.
- [ ] Distributed tracing shows all services involved.
- [ ] Resilience: system degrades gracefully under load.
- [ ] Design doc explains: why sharding over other approaches.
- [ ] Mentored 1 junior on the architecture.
- [ ] README with lessons learned.

### Review
- [ ] Code has been reviewed by a senior engineer.
- [ ] Architecture has been reviewed and approved.
- [ ] Design doc has been reviewed and approved.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Explain sharding strategy to a peer: hash function, hot spots, scaling.
- [ ] System survives 1 node failure (verified with test).
- [ ] Design doc answers: "What if 10x more traffic?".
- [ ] Code review feedback from a peer: "This pattern is solid".
- [ ] 1 junior understands your architecture (pair program).
