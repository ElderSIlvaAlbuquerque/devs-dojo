# Ruby on Rails White Belt

Welcome to the Ruby on Rails White Belt! This curriculum is for those who are new to web development or the Rails framework.

Ruby on Rails (often just "Rails") is a powerful web application framework built on the Ruby programming language. It follows the "convention over configuration" philosophy, which means it makes assumptions about what you need to get started, allowing you to build powerful applications with less code.

Since Rails is built on Ruby, this white belt will start with the absolute basics of the Ruby language itself before moving into the core concepts of the Rails framework.

## What You Will Learn

* The basic syntax of the Ruby language: variables, control structures, methods.
* Working with fundamental Ruby data structures: arrays and hashes.
* The principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Ruby.
* What the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern is.
* How to generate a new Rails application.
* The basics of routing, controllers, and views.
* How to create a simple database model and interact with it.

## Progression

This belt is structured to guide you from zero to your first web application:

1. **Lessons:** Learn the fundamental concepts of Ruby and then Rails.
2. **Daily Exercises:** Solidify your Ruby knowledge with small, focused coding challenges.
3. **Projects:** Apply your skills by building a complete, simple Rails application from scratch.
4. **Checklist:** Track your progress to ensure you've mastered the required concepts.

By the end of this belt, you will understand how a web application works and be able to build and deploy your own simple Rails app.

Let's begin!
