# Go Orange Belt Checklist

This checklist outlines the intermediate concepts and tasks required to achieve your Go Orange Belt.

## Core Concepts

- [ ] Error handling best practices and patterns
- [ ] Goroutines and channels for concurrency
- [ ] Select statement for channel operations
- [ ] Context package for cancellation and timeouts
- [ ] Testing with the testing package (unit tests, table-driven tests)
- [ ] Benchmarking and profiling
- [ ] Working with JSON and XML (encoding/decoding)
- [ ] File I/O and working with the filesystem
- [ ] HTTP servers and clients
- [ ] Middleware patterns
- [ ] Database operations with database/sql
- [ ] Modules and dependency management (go.mod)

## Practical Tasks

- [ ] Write comprehensive tests with high coverage
- [ ] Build a REST API with proper error handling
- [ ] Implement concurrent workers using goroutines
- [ ] Use context for request cancellation
- [ ] Profile and optimize Go code
- [ ] Work with databases (CRUD operations)
- [ ] Handle JSON marshaling/unmarshaling
- [ ] Implement HTTP middleware chain
- [ ] Create and manage Go modules
- [ ] Write benchmarks for performance-critical code

## Projects

- [ ] Build a concurrent web scraper
- [ ] Create a REST API with database persistence
- [ ] Implement a task scheduler with worker pools

Once you can confidently check off these items, you are ready for the Green Belt!
