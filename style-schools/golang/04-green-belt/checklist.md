# Go Green Belt Checklist

This checklist outlines the advanced concepts and tasks required to achieve your Go Green Belt.

## Core Concepts

- [ ] Advanced concurrency patterns (fan-in, fan-out, pipeline)
- [ ] Reflection and the reflect package
- [ ] Generics (type parameters)
- [ ] Code generation (go generate, text/template)
- [ ] Performance optimization and profiling (pprof)
- [ ] Memory management and garbage collection
- [ ] CGo for C interoperability
- [ ] Build tags and conditional compilation
- [ ] Plugin systems
- [ ] gRPC and Protocol Buffers
- [ ] Microservices patterns
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)

## Practical Tasks

- [ ] Optimize code using pprof (CPU and memory profiling)
- [ ] Implement complex concurrent patterns
- [ ] Build gRPC services
- [ ] Use reflection appropriately
- [ ] Write code generators
- [ ] Implement microservices communication patterns
- [ ] Use generics for reusable code
- [ ] Build plugin architecture
- [ ] Integrate distributed tracing
- [ ] Optimize garbage collection behavior

## Projects

- [ ] Build a high-performance microservice with gRPC
- [ ] Create a custom code generation tool
- [ ] Implement a distributed system with service mesh

Once you can confidently check off these items, you are ready for the Purple Belt!
