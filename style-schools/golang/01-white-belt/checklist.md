# Go White Belt Checklist

This checklist outlines the fundamental concepts and tasks required to achieve your Go White Belt.

## Core Concepts

*   [ ] What is Go and what are its main features (statically typed, compiled, garbage collected)?
*   [ ] Setting up a Go development environment (`GOPATH`, `GOROOT`).
*   [ ] The `main` package and `main` function.
*   [ ] Basic syntax: keywords, identifiers, and operators.
*   [ ] Understanding Go's package system (`import`).
*   [ ] Variables: `var`, `:=` (short variable declaration).
*   [ ] Basic Data Types: `int`, `float64`, `string`, `bool`.
*   [ ] Constants (`const`).
*   [ ] Control Flow: `if`/`else`, `for` loops (Go's only loop).
*   [ ] Functions: defining, calling, multiple return values.
*   [ ] Pointers: `*` (pointer type) and `&` (address of operator).
*   [ ] Composite Types:
    *   [ ] Arrays (fixed-size).
    *   [ ] Slices (dynamic-size, `len()`, `cap()`, `append()`).
    *   [ ] Maps (key-value pairs, `make()`, `delete()`).
    *   [ ] Structs (defining custom data structures).

## Practical Tasks

*   [ ] Write and run a "Hello, World!" program.
*   [ ] Create a program that declares variables of different types and prints their values.
*   [ ] Write a function that takes two integers and returns their sum.
*   [ ] Write a program with a `for` loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.
*   [ ] Use an `if/else` statement to check if a number is even or odd.
*   [ ] Create a slice of strings, add a new element to it, and iterate over it with a `for` loop.
*   [ ] Create a map to store the prices of items and retrieve a value.
*   [ ] Define a `Person` struct with `Name` and `Age` fields and create an instance of it.
*   [ ] Create a simple function that accepts a pointer and modifies the value it points to.

## Projects

*   [ ] Build a simple command-line calculator.
*   [ ] Create a program that reads from a file and counts the frequency of words.

Once you can confidently check off these items, you are ready for the Yellow Belt!
