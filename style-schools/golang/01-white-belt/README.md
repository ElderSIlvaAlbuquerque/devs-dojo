# Go White Belt

Welcome to the Go White Belt! This curriculum is designed for complete beginners to the Go programming language (often referred to as Golang).

Go is a statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrent programming. It was created at Google to solve modern engineering challenges, and it's a fantastic language to start with due to its clean syntax and powerful standard library.

## What You Will Learn

*   The basic syntax and structure of a Go program.
*   Variables, data types, and control flow (if/else, for loops).
*   Working with collections: arrays, slices, and maps.
*   Defining and using functions.
*   Understanding Go's type system, including structs.
*   The basics of packages and imports.
*   How to run and build Go applications.

## Progression

This belt is structured to guide you through a clear learning path:

1.  **Lessons:** Start here to understand the core concepts of Go.
2.  **Daily Exercises:** Reinforce your learning with small, daily coding challenges.
3.  **Projects:** Apply all your knowledge by building simple but complete Go applications.
4.  **Checklist:** Keep track of your progress and ensure you've mastered all the required skills.

By the end of this belt, you will have a solid foundation in Go and be prepared to tackle more advanced topics in the Yellow Belt.

Let's get started!
