# Getting Started with React

1.  **Install Node.js and npm**: Follow the instructions on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js and npm.
2.  **Create a new React app**: Run `npx create-react-app my-app`.

## Code Style and Formatting

A consistent code style is essential for readability and maintainability in any project, especially in a team setting. The JavaScript/React ecosystem relies on two primary tools for this.

*   **`Prettier`**: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules. It eliminates all arguments about style. You should integrate Prettier into your editor to format on save and run it across your project before commits.

*   **`ESLint`**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. It helps catch common errors and enforces coding standards. Modern React setups (like Create React App) come with ESLint pre-configured. You should pay attention to its warnings and errors to improve your code quality.
