# React White Belt Checklist

This checklist outlines the fundamental concepts and tasks required to achieve your React White Belt.

## Core Concepts

* [ ] What is React?
* [ ] Understanding Components (Functional vs. Class)
* [ ] JSX - JavaScript XML
* [ ] Props - Passing data down
* [ ] State - Managing component data
* [ ] Event Handling
* [ ] Conditional Rendering
* [ ] List Rendering
* [ ] React Developer Tools

## Practical Tasks

* [ ] Set up a new React project using Create React App or Vite.
* [ ] Create a simple functional component that displays "Hello, React!".
* [ ] Pass a `name` prop to a component and display "Hello, [name]!".
* [ ] Implement a counter component with increment and decrement buttons using state.
* [ ] Display different content based on a boolean state (e.g., show/hide an element).
* [ ] Render a list of items using `map`.
* [ ] Use React Developer Tools to inspect component props and state.

## Projects

* [ ] Build a simple static page with multiple components.
* [ ] Create a basic to-do list application where you can add and mark items as complete.

Upon completion of these items, you will have a solid foundation in React and be ready for the Yellow Belt!
