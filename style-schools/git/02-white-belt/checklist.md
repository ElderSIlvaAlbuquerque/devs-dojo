- [ ] Can explain the difference between Git and GitHub
- [ ] Understand the three states: working, staging, committed
- [ ] Can draw the basic Git workflow on a whiteboard

### Commands

- [ ] Can initialize a repository without looking up syntax
- [ ] Can stage and commit changes confidently
- [ ] Can create and switch branches
- [ ] Can merge branches without fear
- [ ] Can view history and diffs

### Concepts

- [ ] Understand what a commit is (snapshot, not delta)
- [ ] Understand what a branch is (pointer to a commit)
- [ ] Understand what HEAD means
- [ ] Understand basic merge behavior

---

## Practical Skills

### Daily Operations

- [ ] Made 100+ commits total (across all practice)
- [ ] Created 10+ branches
- [ ] Merged 10+ branches
- [ ] Used `git status` habitually (multiple times per day)
- [ ] Used `git diff` before every commit

### Commit Quality

- [ ] All commits in capstone have meaningful messages
- [ ] No "WIP", "fix", "update", or single-word commits
- [ ] Each commit is atomic (one logical change)
- [ ] Can explain why every commit exists

### Branching

- [ ] Created feature branches for all major work
- [ ] Never worked directly on `main` for features
- [ ] Successfully merged branches without breaking code
- [ ] Understand when to create a branch vs commit to current

---

## Capstone Project

### Completion

- [ ] Completed 1 capstone project from [projects.md](./projects.md)
- [ ] Project is on GitHub with public repository
- [ ] README documents the project and Git workflow
- [ ] All promotion criteria from project met

### Git History

- [ ] 20+ meaningful commits
- [ ] 3+ feature branches created and merged
- [ ] `git log --graph --oneline --all` shows clean history
- [ ] No merge conflicts left unresolved
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly ignores files

### Code Quality

- [ ] Project runs without errors
- [ ] README has setup instructions that work
- [ ] Code demonstrates problem-solving, not just Git

---

## Documentation

### README Requirements

- [ ] Project description (what it does)
- [ ] Setup instructions (how to run it)
- [ ] Git workflow explanation (how you used Git)
- [ ] What you learned section

### Git Workflow Documentation

- [ ] Can explain your branching strategy
- [ ] Can explain why you structured commits this way
- [ ] Can explain any merge decisions

---

## Self-Assessment

### Confidence Check

Rate your confidence (1-5) on each:

- [ ] Initializing repositories: \_\_\_\_/5
- [ ] Making commits: \_\_\_\_/5
- [ ] Creating branches: \_\_\_\_/5
- [ ] Merging branches: \_\_\_\_/5
- [ ] Viewing history: \_\_\_\_/5
- [ ] Undoing changes: \_\_\_\_/5
- [ ] Writing commit messages: \_\_\_\_/5

**Target**: All items ≥ 3/5 to advance

### Problem-Solving

Can you solve these without looking up commands?

- [ ] "I staged a file by mistake, how do I unstage it?"
- [ ] "I want to see what changed in the last commit"
- [ ] "I need to work on a new feature without affecting main"
- [ ] "I made a typo in my commit message, how do I fix it?"
- [ ] "I want to see who last edited this line of code"

---

## Code Review

### Peer Review (Optional but Recommended)

- [ ] Had 1 person review your Git history
- [ ] Received feedback on commit quality
- [ ] Incorporated feedback into final version

### Self-Review

- [ ] Reviewed your own `git log` - would you understand it 6 months from now?
- [ ] Checked every commit - does it build/run successfully?
- [ ] Verified no sensitive data in history (passwords, API keys)

---

## Presentation (Optional)

Can you present your project and explain:

- [ ] Why you chose this project
- [ ] How you structured your Git workflow
- [ ] What Git commands you used most
- [ ] What Git challenges you faced
- [ ] What you'd do differently next time

**Practice**: Explain your project to someone unfamiliar with Git. If they understand your workflow, you've mastered the basics.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Before checking off promotion, ensure you didn't:

- [ ] ❌ Have commits with messages like "asdf", "test", "WIP"
- [ ] ❌ Commit everything at once in giant commits
- [ ] ❌ Work directly on `main` for all changes
- [ ] ❌ Have merge conflicts in final history
- [ ] ❌ Commit sensitive data (passwords, keys, tokens)
- [ ] ❌ Have build artifacts or dependencies in Git (should be in `.gitignore`)

---

## Final Checklist

- [ ] ✅ Completed all Knowledge Check items
- [ ] ✅ Completed all Practical Skills items
- [ ] ✅ Completed 1 capstone project
- [ ] ✅ Project meets all requirements
- [ ] ✅ Documentation is complete
- [ ] ✅ Self-assessment shows confidence ≥ 3/5 on all items
- [ ] ✅ No common mistakes present
