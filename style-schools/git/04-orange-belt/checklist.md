# Git Orange Belt Checklist

This checklist outlines the advanced concepts and tasks required to achieve your Git Orange Belt.

## Core Concepts

- [ ] Git internals (objects, trees, blobs, commits)
- [ ] Advanced rebasing (interactive, onto, preserving merges)
- [ ] Git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push, post-receive)
- [ ] Submodules and subtrees
- [ ] Git worktrees for parallel development
- [ ] Bisecting to find bugs
- [ ] Advanced history rewriting (filter-branch, filter-repo)
- [ ] Git reflog and recovery techniques
- [ ] Custom merge strategies
- [ ] Monorepo strategies and techniques
- [ ] Git LFS for large files
- [ ] Signing commits and tags (GPG)

## Practical Tasks

- [ ] Set up and use Git hooks in a project
- [ ] Use `git bisect` to find a bug-introducing commit
- [ ] Manage a submodule or subtree
- [ ] Work with multiple worktrees simultaneously
- [ ] Recover lost commits using reflog
- [ ] Rewrite history to remove sensitive data
- [ ] Sign commits with GPG key
- [ ] Create and maintain a monorepo
- [ ] Optimize large repository performance
- [ ] Implement custom Git aliases and scripts

## Projects

- [ ] Build a Git-based CI/CD pipeline with hooks
- [ ] Manage a complex multi-repo project with submodules
- [ ] Create custom Git automation tools

Once you can confidently check off these items, you are ready for the Brown Belt!
