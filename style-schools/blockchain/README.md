# ⛓️ Blockchain Systems Engineering Dojo

Welcome to **Blockchain Systems Engineering**, the style school for building decentralized systems and smart contracts.

**Why Blockchain Engineering is Unique**:
- **Decentralization**: No central authority; consensus across distributed nodes
- **Immutability**: Once recorded, data cannot be changed (not even by creator)
- **Cryptography-First**: Trustlessness through cryptographic proofs
- **Distributed Consensus**: Nodes must agree on state without trusting each other
- **State Replication**: Every node maintains a copy (vs database sharding)
- **Gas Costs**: Operations have explicit financial costs (unique optimization problem)
- **Regulatory Uncertainty**: Rules change as governments define crypto regulations
- **Irreversibility**: Mistakes are permanent; testing is critical

## Why Blockchain Engineering?

Blockchain is the next frontier for distributed systems engineering. Unlike traditional distributed systems that rely on a trusted operator, blockchains are trustless. This requires solving problems differently:

- Strong consistency through consensus (no eventually-consistent systems)
- Everyone has a copy (no sharding, but requires optimization)
- Incentive alignment (economic security, not access control)
- Immutability as a feature (not a bug)

These principles are shaping the future of decentralized applications.
