# Blockchain Green Belt Checklist

## Core Concepts

- [ ] Advanced smart contract patterns (upgradeability, proxies, diamond)
- [ ] Security: reentrancy, access control, formal specs
- [ ] Gas optimization and calldata efficiency
- [ ] DeFi primitives (AMMs, lending, liquidations)
- [ ] Cross-chain bridges and messaging
- [ ] Layer-2 and rollups (optimistic, zk)
- [ ] MEV, transaction ordering, and mitigation
- [ ] Oracles and data integrity
- [ ] Testing with fuzzing and invariant frameworks
- [ ] Auditing workflows and static analysis
- [ ] Node and RPC reliability at scale

## Practical Tasks

- [ ] Implement upgradeable contracts with transparent proxy or UUPS
- [ ] Add role-based access control and pause/kill switches
- [ ] Write invariants and fuzz tests for core protocols
- [ ] Optimize gas usage and document trade-offs
- [ ] Integrate oracle feeds with fallback logic
- [ ] Model and mitigate MEV and sandwich risks
- [ ] Build bridge or messaging demo with replay protection
- [ ] Deploy to L2 and compare fees/performance
- [ ] Set up monitoring (events, health, chain reorg alerts)
- [ ] Produce audit checklist and threat model

## Projects

- [ ] Secure DeFi protocol with audits and monitoring
- [ ] Cross-chain bridge with safety guards
- [ ] L2-optimized dApp with MEV-aware design
